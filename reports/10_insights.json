    "report_summary": "The mobile app market, comprising nearly 10,000 analyzed applications across Google Play and a mock App Store, is overwhelmingly dominated by free offerings, accounting for nearly 90% of all apps. While categories such as Communication, Social, and Photography lead significantly in total install volume, indicating massive user engagement, paid applications, despite their smaller market share, consistently achieve higher average user ratings, suggesting a perceived higher quality or value proposition. Furthermore, there's a notable divergence between install volume and user sentiment, with categories like Finance and Games demonstrating strong positive sentiment, pointing towards opportunities in less saturated segments or for highly satisfying niche products. Developers should strategically assess market saturation, user sentiment, and monetization models to identify viable pathways for success.",
    "key_metrics_snapshot": "Total apps analyzed: 9984. The market is 89.33% Free apps and 10.67% Paid apps. Paid apps average a higher rating of 4.46 compared to Free apps at 4.34. The top 5 categories by total installs are COMMUNICATION (18.5B), SOCIAL (12.4B), PHOTOGRAPHY (11.1B), GAME (10.4B), and NEWS_AND_MAGAZINES (8.0B). Finance leads in average sentiment polarity at 0.2786, followed by Games at 0.2327.",
