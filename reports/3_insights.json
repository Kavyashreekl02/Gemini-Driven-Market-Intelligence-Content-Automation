    "report_summary": "The mobile app market is predominantly free, with 89.33% of applications being free-to-use. Paid apps, despite their minority status (10.67%), boast a higher average rating (4.46) compared to free apps (4.34). Categories like Communication, Social, and Photography lead in total installs, all maintaining strong average ratings above 4.3. Interestingly, categories with the highest positive sentiment, such as Finance, do not necessarily correspond with the highest install volumes, indicating distinct drivers for mass adoption versus intense user satisfaction. This suggests opportunities in high-sentiment niches and strategic considerations for monetization models.",
